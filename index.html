            <h2>Gameplay</h2>

            <p>Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration; it features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, such as the Souls series,
                Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that players start with a linear opening but eventually progress to freely explore the Lands Between, including its six main areas, as well as castles, fortresses,
                and catacombs scattered throughout the open world map. These main areas are interconnected through a central hub that players can access later in the game's progression—similar to Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls—and are explorable using
                the character's mount as the main mode of transport, although a fast travel system is an available option. Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies alike, including the demigods who rule each main
                area and serve as the game's main bosses.</p>
            <p>Combat in Elden Ring relies heavily on character-building elements found in previous Souls games and related intellectual properties, such as calculated and close-ranged melee-based combat with the use of skills, magic abilities, as well as
                blocking and dodging mechanics. Elden Ring introduces mounted combat and a stealth system, the latter being a core gameplay element from Sekiro; these features are expected to encourage players in strategizing their combat approach with
                each unique enemy they encounter. The game makes use of a player character stamina bar after being absent from Sekiro, although its overall influence over combat was reduced compared to previous FromSoftware games that utilized it. Unlike
                in Sekiro, resurrection mechanics after in-game death are not available; however, some elements were added to ensure players' progression within the game.</p>
            <p>Miyazaki stated that the customization in Elden Ring would be richer, as players are able to discover different skills through their exploration of the map instead of unlocking skill trees as in Sekiro and differing from the pre-fixed weapon
                skills of FromSoftware's previous games. These skills are interchangeable with a large variety of weapons which, alongside equipment, magic abilities, and items players can craft using materials found within the world, can be used to customize
                the player character.[2][4] The game also features summoning mechanics, where players can summon a large variety of collectible spirits hidden throughout the game's world map, including previously defeated enemies, as allies to assist
                them in battle. Similar to the Souls series, the game's multiplayer allows other players to be summoned for cooperative play.</p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Premise</h3>
                <p>Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, sometime after the destruction of the titular Elden Ring and the scattering of its shards, the Great Runes. Once graced by the Ring and the Erdtree which symbolizes its presence, the realm is
                    now ruled over by the demigod offspring of Queen Marika the Eternal, each possessing a shard of the Ring that corrupts and taints them with power. As Tarnished — exiles from the Lands Between who lost the Ring's grace and are summoned
                    back after the Shattering — players must traverse the realm to ultimately find all the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>The Tarnished is one of many exiles called back to the Lands Between in hopes of repairing the Elden Ring and becoming the next Elden Lord. Early on in their journey, the Tarnished encounters a young woman named Melina, who offers to stand
                    in as their maiden to help them on their journey, under the condition that the Tarnished bring her to the base of the Erdtree where she can fulfill her purpose. She also takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place
                    for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring. There, the Tarnished learns from their divine benefactor, the Two Fingers, that in the wake of the Shattering and Queen Marika's disappearance, her demigod children had taken the
                    Great Runes, pieces of the Elden Ring, for themselves, and now war against each other to try and obtain the other Great Runes. The last known Great Rune holders are Godrick the Grafted, General Radahn, Praetor Rykard, Morgott the Grace-Given,
                    Malenia the Blade of Miquella, and Rennala of the Full Moon.</p>
                <p>The Tarnished then proceeds to journey into the Lands Between, investigating its various locales and defeating each demigod one by one until they recover enough Great Runes that the Two Fingers feels they are ready to journey to the Erdtree
                    to confront Morgott, the final obstacle to the tree. Upon his defeat, Morgott claims that the Erdtree will not allow anybody, especially a Tarnished, to enter it before passing away. The Tarnished confirms this when they approach the
                    Erdtree and find their way blocked by a wall of thorns. Melina then arrives and advises that they journey to find the Flame of Ruin, which they can use to set the Erdtree on fire and burn away the thorns. In light of the Tarnished
                    being rebuffed from the Erdtree, the Two Fingers withdraws from the mortal plane to consider its next move, leaving the Tarnished free to proceed with Melina's plan or search for the imprisoned Three Fingers to gain the power of the
                    Frenzied Flame.</p>
                <p>Upon obtaining the Flame of Ruin, if the Tarnished did not free the Three Fingers, then Melina will take the flame and sacrifice herself to set the Erdtree on fire. If the Tarnished freed the Three Fingers, then Melina will abandon the
                    Tarnished, forcing them to use their own power to set the Erdtree on fire. Regardless, the Tarnished then proceeds to the Erdtree, where they battle the fellow Tarnished warrior Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing, as well as the First Elden
                    Lord Godfrey to gain access to the interior of the Erdtree. Inside, they fight the reanimated remains of Queen Marika's consort, Radagon, as well as the godlike Elden Beast. Upon vanquishing both foes, the Tarnished finally gains access
                    to Queen Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring. Depending on the Tarnished's actions throughout the game, six different endings are possible, ranging from the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord in some
                    form, allowing Marika to be usurped by Ranni the Witch, to using the Frenzied Flame to destroy the Erdtree and the Lands Between.</p>

            <h2>Development and release</h2>
            <p>Elden Ring was developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It was announced at E3 2019 originally for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.[9] No further information was revealed until a June 2021 trailer
                announced a release date of January 21, 2022, with additional releases on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.[10] In October 2021, it was announced that the game would be delayed to February 25, 2022.</p>
            <p>Elden Ring is directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding by fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin, best known for his A Song of Ice and Fire novel series.[12] A fan of Martin's work, Miyazaki contacted him with an offer to work together
                on a project, giving him the creative freedom to write the overarching backstory of the game's universe. Miyazaki used his contributions as the foundation of the game's narrative, comparing the process to that of using a "dungeon master's
                handbook in a tabletop RPG".[12][13] Some staff from the Game of Thrones television series adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire also assisted with the game's development.[14] As with many of Miyazaki's previous games, the story was designed
                to not be clearly explained as FromSoftware intended for players to interpret it for themselves via flavor text and optional discussions with non-player characters (NPCs).[13][15] Miyazaki hoped Martin's contributions would produce a more
                accessible narrative than the studio's previous games. Notable play testers such as Harrison Harvey of NVIDIA were acquired to test these interactions before the game’s release.</p>
            <p>Work began on the game in early 2017 following the release of The Ringed City, a piece of downloadable content for Dark Souls III, and was developed alongside Sekiro.[17] As with games in the Souls series, players have the ability to create
                their own custom character instead of using a fixed protagonist.[13] Miyazaki also considered Elden Ring to be a more "natural evolution" to the Souls series, featuring an open world with new gameplay mechanics such as horseback riding.[13][17]
                Unlike many other open-world games, Elden Ring does not feature populated towns with NPCs, with the world having numerous dungeon-like ruins in their place.[13] Miyazaki cited Fumito Ueda's work such as Shadow of the Colossus (2005) as
                an influence that "inspired him to create" Elden Ring, while also drawing influence from "the design and the freedom of play" in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017).[18] Yuka Kitamura, who has composed for many of Miyazaki's
                previous games, contributed to the game's soundtrack.[19]</p>

            <h2>Reception</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Elden Ring received "universal acclaim" according to review aggregator Metacritic.[20][21][22] The game ranks as the second highest-reviewed game on OpenCritic.[38][39] On Twitch, it drew nearly 900,000 viewers within 24 hours of release,
                    making it the third-largest debut on the platform after Lost Ark and Cyberpunk 2077.[40] The game's difficulty has provoked much commentary, receiving both praise and criticism for it and its lack of easier modes.[41][42][43][44][45][46]
                    The PC version of the game was criticized at launch for having performance issues.[47]</p>
                <p>The Guardian praised the sense of exploration present in the game.[35] Destructoid felt the story was better told than in previous Souls games.[23] While criticizing the game's map for not properly conveying height changes, Ars Technica
                    enjoyed the game's horse riding mechanics.[48] Eurogamer praised the world design.[49] Polygon liked how the game gave players more options to fight enemies, but still kept a sense of challenge intact.[50] IGN praised the lack of objective
                    markers in Elden Ring, but felt that the game should have some sort of quest log or journal to note plot threads.[31] While enjoying the open world, Game Informer highlighted the level design of the dungeons.[26] PCGamesN felt the
                    UI improvements made the game vastly more accessible.[33]</p>
                <p>Negative reviews including Ed Thorn pointed out that the platform of Elden Ring is not as impressive even compared with some older games like Super Mario 64. [51] Ed pointed out that unlike other games like Hollow Knight or Celeste or
                    even Super Mario 64, which all have "precise and snappy movement", Elden Ring is a terrible platformer, "It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast."</p>

                <h3>Sales</h3>
                <p>Elden Ring sold 12 million copies worldwide after 17 days of its release, with one million in Japan alone.[52][53] This makes it one of the fastest-selling open world games of all time, outpacing Grand Theft Auto IV, Skyrim, The Witcher
                    3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with a launch sales pace comparable to Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Cyberpunk 2077.[53] It has also outpaced other previous major launches including The Division, Diablo
                    3, Borderlands, God of War, GTA Trilogy and Resident Evil 7.[54]</p>
                <p>The PC version of Elden Ring drew 734,000 concurrent players on Steam within minutes of its launch, surpassing Dark Souls III and Sekiro to become FromSoftware's largest launch on the service.[55] It topped the Steam weekly sales chart
                    upon launch, with various editions of the game occupying four positions in the top five: the top three spots and number five.[56] As of 7 March 2022, it reached a peak of 953,000 concurrent players on Steam, ranking it among the highest
                    on the platform in its history.[57]</p>
                <p>It was the best-selling retail game in Japan during its first week of release, with 278,507 physical units sold that week; the PlayStation 4 version ranked first with 188,490 copies sold while the PlayStation 5 version ranked second with

                <p>In the United States, Elden Ring debuted as the best-selling game of February 2022 and more generally the best-selling game of early 2022. Despite releasing in the last week of February, it had the second largest US launch month sales
                    of any game released in the previous twelve months, second only to Call of Duty: Vanguard in November 2021. Its strong launch week sales propelled Elden Ring to already becoming the fifth best-selling game of the past twelve months.[61]</p>
                <p>In Europe, it was the best-selling game of February 2022 and became the largest launch for a new IP since The Division in 2016; the PC version accounted for 44% of sales, followed by the PlayStation versions with 40% and then Xbox with
                    16% of sales.[62] In the United Kingdom, Elden Ring debuted at the top of the physical sales chart, with launch week sales surpassing Dark Souls III to make it the largest UK launch for a soulslike game and the third largest physical
                    launch of early 2022 after Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Horizon Forbidden West.[63] With digital sales included, Elden Ring had the largest UK launch of early 2022, with launch week sales 2.5 times higher than Horizon: Forbidden West
                    the previous week. Elden Ring also had the largest UK launch outside of the FIFA and Call of Duty franchises since Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018.[64] After its first week of release, Elden Ring topped the UK monthly chart in February
                    2022, selling twice as much as the second-place title Horizon Forbidden West that month. Elden Ring became the fastest-selling new IP in the UK since The Division in 2016.[65] In Spain, Elden Ring reached 60,500 physical copies during
                    its launch week, making it FromSoftware's strongest game launch in the region.[66]</p>
